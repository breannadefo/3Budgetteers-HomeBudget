# 3Budgetteers-HomeBudget

## Goal
This project uses C# and WPF to create an app that helps you keep a budget and track your spendings. The application makes you connect to a database, then lets you access all your data. This application was created for a semester long group project in one of our classes. The purpose of it was to learn how to use the SCRUM model when working on projects with other people.

## Key Features
### **Use a Database:** 
The first screen that shows up will ask you to use a database. You can either use an existing one, or create a new one.

### **Adding Expenses:** 
There is a screen that lets you add an expense. If the information entered for each field is valid, the expense will be added to the database when the 'Add' button is clicked.
